			<p> Outside of modeling, Karlie’s passion and curiosity around for technology and science led her to take her first coding class in 2014 at the Flatiron School in New York City. Inspired by code’s endless possibility, Karlie founded Kode With Klossy in 2015 to engage, empower and prepare women and girls to learn code, while expanding access to coding education and opportunities. This year, Kode With Klossy is providing nearly 300 scholarships to young women and girls ages 13 to 18 to enroll in a free two-week summer coding course, growing from 21 scholarships in 2015 and 80 scholarships in 2016. In 2017, Karlie was featured on the cover of Fast Company for her work with Kode With Klossy and also appeared alongside Bill Nye in the original Netflix series ‘Bill Nye Saves The World’, where she explores different topics in science.
